RockMine Accuracy Prediction with Machine Learning

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting accuracy levels for RockMine, an innovative mining technology. Using Python and popular libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib, this project demonstrates the process of data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation.

Key Features:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handling missing values, scaling features, and transforming data for optimal model performance.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing data distributions, correlations, and insights to understand the underlying patterns.

Feature Engineering: Creating new features to enhance predictive power and model accuracy.

Machine Learning Models: Implementing various algorithms such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and SVM to predict accuracy levels.

Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC curves.

Deployment: Optionally, guidelines or scripts for deploying the trained model in a production environment.


This project serves as a practical example of applying machine learning techniques to predict accuracy in mining operations, potentially aiding in resource optimization and operational efficiency.
